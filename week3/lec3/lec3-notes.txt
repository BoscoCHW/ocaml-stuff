- Exceptions
  * can define our own exceptions, e.g. exception Empty
  * raise
	* try/with

- I/O
  * Printf: printf, fprintf, sprint, eprintf
	* Scanf: scanf

- partial vs total functions
- pure vs impure functions (calculations/computations vs actions)
  * no side effects vs has side effects

- sum types (variants)
  * type 'a bstree = Leaf | Node of 'a * 'a bstree * 'a bstree
	  - bstree is a type constructor
		- Leaf and Node are data/value constructor
		  * Leaf is already a value
		- note: constructors are not functions
